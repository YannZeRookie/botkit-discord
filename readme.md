> ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¾ A Botkit connector for Discord

This Botkit connector would not be possible without the powerful and simple library, [izy521/discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io). 

> Please Note: This is still a work in progress and I will continue to add more functionalities as I dig deeper into documentation.

## Usage

```javascript
const BotkitDiscord = require('botkit-discord');
const config = {
    token: '**' // Discord bot token
}

const discordBot = BotkitDiscord(config);

discordBot.hears('hello','direct_message',(bot, message) => {
    bot.reply('how goes there :)!')
});
```

Refer to [Botkit documentation](https://botkit.ai/docs/) to utilize all of the other Botkit features.
