// if no rating is stored, we can end convoersation
discordBot.hears('b!play', 'ambient', (bot, message) => {
	bot.api.joinVoiceChannel().then(connection => {
		dispatcher = connection.play('./music/funny.mp3')
		dispatcher.setVolume(0.5)
		dispatcher.on('finish', () => {
			bot.createConversation(message, (err, convo) => {
				convo.addQuestion('How would rate that from a scale of 0 to 5?', (response, convo) => {
					const numberRating = response.text.match(/[0-5]/g);
					if (nummberRating.length < 1) {
						convo.say('Uhh... not a valid rating, try again later!');
						convo.next();
					}

					db.save(message.member.id, numberRating[0]);
					convo.next();
				});
			});
		})
		bot.api.leaveVoiceChannel();
